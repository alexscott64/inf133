                <p> I write code to make life easier. I am currently a senior at University
                    of California, Irvine and will be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science in
                    Fall 2016. I enjoy information retrieval, machine learning, data mining, and
                    finding ways to make things faster. This is my midterm / final project site for
                    Informatics 133. Hopefully I get an A

                        <p>User interviews are important because they give us an insight into
                        who that user is, and why they would want to or not want to use a service.
                        I asked two types of questions. The first set was about the user, including
                        who they are and what their goals are. And the second type of question I asked
                        was about the general idea of a personal portfolio site, and what kinds of things
                        they would like to see or not see on that site.

                        <p>A competitor analysis is an evaluation of competitor's products, including
                        what they are doing right, what they are doing wrong, and how they get there.
                        The sites I chose to evaluate were mainly computer science and
                        math related portfolios. I evaluated them because I wanted to make a site
                        with similar content eventually.

                        <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
                        <p>A feature value matrix is a matrix that is used to organize features
                        based on their business value, user value and technical effort. Features with
                        low total scores have high priority while features with high total scores have
                            low priority. For the feature value matrix, I focused on
                        site usability via improved navigation and better mobile support, contact by
                        form to make contacting me easier, and improving my portfolio section  to
                        accurately show projects I've worked on.

                        <p>I prioritized fixing navigation issues and adding increased mobile support before
                            prioritizing other issues like updating my portfolio, adding support for older
                            browsers, and adding a contact by form instead of the original email link. By fixing
                            the navigation and mobile issues first, I was able to build a stable interface
                            that I could depend and build upon.

                        <p>Coming up with user stories is extremely important. When creating them I
                        thought about different types of users: programmers, HR people scanning the
                        site after learning about it through my resume, and user's accessing the site
                        via mobile device. Using these types of users I wanted to focus on how the user
                        would navigate through my site, how the content would look like on all devices,
                        and how they would interpret the different sections on my site.

                        <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
                        <p>A cognitive walkthrough is where one or more evaluators works through a
                        series of tasks and asks a set of questions from the perspective of the user.
                        This allows us to gain insight into how a user completes a certain task.
                        The problem with some of the cognitive walkthroughs I did was that a lot
                        of my questions received one word, obvious answers. It was hard to get useful
                        information without asking the right types of questions.

                        second tests. I chose to use click tests to see if user's could figure
                        out the navigation menu without text hints. I chose to use a five second test
                        to see if the user could remember key content on the page. This five second
                        test showed me if the fonts and colors I chose for the site were nice to look at
                        and not too distracting. Turns out, almost every one of the users who took the
                        tests were able to pass.

                <p>
                    All of the user tests, walkthroughs, and general studying of competition
                    gave me a few areas to focus on and fix that would both improve the user experience
                    and would help people get a better idea of who I was and what I had
                    done. These areas were navigation, compatibility, and content.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Navigation was an issue that I felt could be fixed quite easily. I initially thought
                    that the navigation didn't need any text or explanations, and therefore chose to opt
                    to use recognizable icons as the buttons to navigate through the site. Unfortunately,
                    this lead to some ambiguity about what a button actually did or didn't do. This became
                    apparent in the user click tests, which showed that some people really didn't know where
                    the portfolio was initially. I didn't want this to be an issue in case someone who wanted
                    to hire me was put-off by the navigation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Compatibility was the second issue I found out about. Trying to make my site viewable
                    through Internet Explorer, and through tablets and mobile sites is challenging due to
                    the sheer amount of fine tuning that needs to be done for each specific browser. The
                    main issue I had was that a user on a screen reader couldn't actually see images for
                    navigation, and thus it would be impossible to actually jump to parts of my site. A
                    solution for this issue was to include text that could be seen when the navigation is
                    hovered on.

                    Content was the third issue I wanted to focus on. My portfolio isn't an actual portfolio
                    right now since it only says that I completed code academy. I learned that this placeholder
                    technique doesn't work out well and that I need to update my portfolio immediately. I also
                    learned through the competitive analysis and through interviews that a blog is an important
                    aspect of a personal portfolio. By posting about programming topics I've learned about or
                    personal stories relating to programming, I can make my site more interesting and useful
                    to anyone, instead of a select group of people.

                    I was able to incorporate some of my findings for the final site, but some others had
                    to be put off due to a lack of time. First, I wasn't able to incorporate a blog mainly
                    because that takes time and a blog plugin (like Wordpress). Creating my own would be
                    difficult, and could get messy quickly. I also wasn't able to update my portfolio in time.
                    This was because most of my projects are executables or web app projects. I didn't have time
                    to set up an Amazon AWS instance to actually run the databases, connections, and other related
                    server items to make my projects work online. I was able to get some things to work, however.

                    The first issue I fixed was the navigation. To do this correctly, I had to move everything
                    down so that I had enough space for the pop-up text over the navigation icons. To do this,
                    I set the CSS of the wrapper for the site to have padding at the top. Then, I created a span
                    attribute with an opacity of zero and a negative margin (to push it above the icon). I also
                    created a box with a background for the text to sit on. When the user hovers over an icon, the
                    span element's opacity is set to one, making the content visible. The picture on the left shows
                    the navigation before (without any helpful text) and the picture on the right shows the new and
                    improved navigation menu.

                    The second issue I fixed was the contact form. I was only able to half complete this part however,
                    as I wasn't sure if I was allowed to use PHP. For the time being I created a simple form that
                    has an action set to my e-mail address. In future versions of the site, I would tie the action
                    to a PHP script that would send me the corresponding e-mail after it is parsed out of the form.
                    Below are two pictures of the contact system. The first one is the old version while the second
                    picture is the new contact system.
